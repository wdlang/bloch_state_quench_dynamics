## Abstract 
We take a one-dimensional tight-binding chain with periodic boundary condition and put a particle in an arbitrary Bloch state, then quench it by suddenly changing the potential of an arbitrary site. In the ensuing time evolution, the probability density of the wave function at an arbitrary site jumps indefinitely between plateaus. This phenomenon adds to a former one in which the survival probability of the particle in the initial Bloch state shows cusps periodically, which was found in the same scenario (Zhang J. M. and Yang H.-T., EPL, 114 (2016) 60001). The plateaus support the scattering wave picture of the quench dynamics of the Bloch state. Underlying the cusps and jumps is the exactly solvable, nonanalytic dynamics of a Luttinger-like model, based on which, the locations of the jumps and the heights of the plateaus are accurately predicted.

## Usage 
Just run the matlab scripts and you will get all the figures in the paper.
